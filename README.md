# Expense Tracker

A simple CLI-based expense tracker built with Python and SQLite. This project helps you record, view, and manage your daily expenses efficiently.

## Features

- **Add Expense:** Enter date, category, amount, and description for each expense.
- **View Expenses:** List all recorded expenses, sorted by date.
- **Total by Category:** See the total expenditure per category.
- **Delete Expense:** Remove an expense by its unique ID.
- **Persistent Storage:** All data is stored locally in an SQLite database (`expenses.db`).
